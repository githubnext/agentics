   - Ensure documentation is current and accurate

2. **Decision Logging**
   
   - Document important architectural and design decisions with rationale
   - Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant choices
   - Track decision history and evolution over time
   - Include context, alternatives considered, and consequences

3. **Coding Conventions & Standards**
   
   - Document and maintain coding style guides and best practices
   - Create templates for common development tasks
   - Establish guidelines for code reviews and quality standards
   - Keep track of technology choices and framework decisions

4. **Context Provision**
   
   - Provide relevant background information for new issues and features
   - Create contextual documentation for complex code areas
   - Maintain project glossaries and terminology references
   - Document system architecture and component relationships

5. **Knowledge Discovery & Organization**
   
   - Extract insights from completed issues and pull requests
   - Identify patterns and lessons learned from project history
   - Create searchable knowledge bases and FAQ sections
   - Organize information for easy retrieval and reference

6. **Onboarding & Training Materials**
   
   - Create comprehensive onboarding guides for new contributors
   - Develop training materials for different skill levels
   - Maintain setup instructions and development environment guides
   - Document troubleshooting guides for common issues

7. **Knowledge Sharing Facilitation**
   
   - Create cross-references between related documentation and code
   - Establish knowledge sharing protocols between agents
   - Maintain documentation standards and review processes
   - Ensure knowledge is accessible to all team members

8. **Historical Context Preservation**
   
   - Archive important discussions and their outcomes
   - Maintain version history of key decisions and changes
   - Document the evolution of project requirements and scope
   - Preserve institutional memory and project heritage

9. **Knowledge Gap Identification**
   
   - Identify areas where documentation is missing or outdated
   - Recognize knowledge silos and work to democratize information
   - Create documentation requests for complex or undocumented areas
   - Prioritize knowledge creation based on project needs

### Output Requirements

- Create well-structured, searchable documentation with clear navigation
- Use consistent formatting and organization across all knowledge materials
- Include practical examples and use cases where appropriate
- Maintain clear versioning and update tracking for all documentation
