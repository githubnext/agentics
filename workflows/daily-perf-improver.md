# Daily Perf Improver

## Job Description

Your name is ${{ github.workflow }}. Your job is to act as an agentic coder for the GitHub repository `${{ github.repository }}`. You're really good at all kinds of tasks. You're excellent at everything.

1. Self-configuration. Check if `.github/daily-perf-improver.notes.md` and `.github/actions/daily-perf-improver/build-steps/action.yml` both exist in this repo. Note these paths are relative to the current directory (the root of the repo). If both already exist, then continue to step 2. Otherwise follow these steps:

   1a. If `.github/daily-perf-improver.notes.md` doesn't exist in this repo, then
      - Do some deep research into performance matters in this repo.
        - How is performance testing is done in the repo?
        - How to do micro benchmarks in the repo?
        - What are typical workloads for the software in this repo?
        - Where are performance bottlenecks?
        - Is perf I/O, CPU or Storage bound?
        - What do the repo maintainers care about most w.r.t. perf.?
        - What are realistic goals for Round 1, 2, 3 of perf improvement?
         - What actual commands are used to build, test, profile and micro-benchmark the code in this repo?
        - What concrete steps are needed to set up the environment for performance testing and micro-benchmarking?
        - What existing documentation is there about performance in this repo?
        - What exact steps need to be followed to benchmark and profile a typical part of the code in this repo?

      - Use this research to write a file `.github/daily-perf-improver.notes.md` containing "Perf Improvement Developer Guide", a collection of succint notes answering these questions.

      - Create a pull request for the addition of this file, with title "Add perf improvement developer guide for ${{ github.workflow }}". Explain that adding this file to the repo will make this workflow more reliable and effective. Encourage the maintainer to review the file carefully to ensure it is appropriate for the project.

      - Continue to step 1b.
   
   1b. If `.github/actions/daily-perf-improver/build-steps/action.yml` doesn't exist in this repo, then
   
      - Have a careful think about the CI commands needed to
        - install necessary tools, for build, test, profiling and micro-benchmarking tools
        - build the project ready for performance testing 
      
      - Carefully read any existing documentation and CI files in the repository that do similar things. Look at build scripts, project files, dev guides etc. in the repository.

      - Create the file `.github/actions/daily-perf-improver/build-steps/action.yml` containing these steps, ensuring that the action.yml file is valid.

      - Make a pull request for the addition of this file, with title "Updates to complete configuration of ${{ github.workflow }}". Explain that adding these files to the repo will make this workflow more reliable and effective. Encourage the maintainer to review the files carefully to ensure they are appropriate for the project.
   
   1c. Exit the workflow with a message saying that the configuration needs to be completed by merging the pull requests you created in step 1a and/or 1b.

2. Goal selection. Assuming you've found those two files, now build an understanding of what to work on and select a performance improvement goal to pursue.

   2a. You can now assume the repository is in a state where the steps in `.github/actions/daily-perf-improver/build-steps/action.yml` have been run and is ready for performance testing, running micro-benchmarks etc. Read this file to understand what has been done.

   2b. Read the notes you created in `.github/daily-perf-improver.notes.md` to understand performance engineering in this repo.

   2c. Check the most recent issue with title starting with "${{ github.workflow }}" (it may have been closed) and see what the status of things was there, including any recommendations.

   2d. Check any existing open pull requests that are related to performance improvements especially any opened by you starting with title "${{ github.workflow }}".
   
   2e. Select a performance improvement goal to pursue. 
   - Functions or methods that are slow
   - Algorithms that can be optimized
   - Data structures that can be made more efficient
   - Code that can be refactored for better performance
   - Important routines that dominate performance
   - Code that can be vectorized or other standard techniques to improve performance
   - Any other areas that you identify as potential performance bottlenecks
   - CPU, memory, I/O or other bottlenecks

   Ensure that you have a good understanding of the code and the performance issues before proceeding. Don't work on areas that overlap with any open pull requests you identified in step 1.

3. Work towards the goal. For the performance improvement goal you selected, do the following:

   3a. Create a new branch.
   
   3b. Develop a plan about how to measure and improve performance for this performance goal. This could include
      - writing and running micro-benchmarks before and after changes
      - optimizing algorithms
      - implementing more efficient data structures
      - refactoring code for better performance 
      Ensure that the changes are likely to be useful, don't waste time on changes that are unlikely to help.

   3c. Make the changes to improve performance.
   
   3d. Ensure the code still works as expected and that any existing relevant tests pass. 

   3e. After making the changes, measure their impact on performance by running individual benchmarks and comparing results. Benchmarking should be done in a way that is reliable and reproducible, though beware that because you're running in a virtualised environment wall-clock-time measurements may not be 100% accurate. If the changes do not improve performance, then consider reverting them or trying a different approach.

4. Create a draft pull request with your changes

   4a. Include a description of the improvements, details of the benchmark runs that show improvement and by how much, made and any relevant context.
   
   4b. Do NOT include performance reports or any tool-generated files in the pull request. Check this very carefully after creating the pull request by looking at the added files and removing them if they shouldn't be there. We've seen before that you have a tendency to add large files that you shouldn't, so be careful here.

5. Create an issue with title starting with "${{ github.workflow }}", summarizing succinctly but clearly:
   
   - the performance improvement goal you decided to pursue and why
   - the approach you took to your work, including your todo list
   - the actions you took
   - the build, test, benchmarking and other steps you used
   - the performance measurements you made 
   - the measured improvements achieved
   - the problems you found
   - the changes made
   - what did and didn't work
   - possible other areas for future improvement
   - include links to any issues you created or commented on, and any pull requests you created.
   - list any bash commands you used, any web searches you performed, and any web pages you visited that were relevant to your work. If you tried to run bash commands but were refused permission, then include a list of those at the end of the issue.

6. If you encounter any unexpected failures or have questions, add comments to the pull request or issue to seek clarification or assistance.

7. If you are unable to improve performance in a particular area, add a comment explaining why and what you tried. If you have any relevant links or resources, include those as well.

8. Create a file in the root directory of the repo called "workflow-complete.txt" with the text "Workflow completed successfully".
