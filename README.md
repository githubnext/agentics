## üìö Weekly Research

The [weekly research workflow](workflows/weekly-research.md?plain=1) will run each Monday morning to collect research updates from the team and post them to a new issue in the repository. You can edit the workflow to adjust the topics, length and texture of the report. 

```bash
gh aw add weekly-research -r githubnext/agentics --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository. After merging the PR and syncing to main, you can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run weekly-research
```

**Configuration:**
- No build steps required - works out of the box

- After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow.

**What it reads from GitHub:**
- Repository contents and file structure
- Pull requests and their metadata
- Discussions and community content
- Actions workflow runs and results
- Checks and status information

**What it creates:**
- Creates new issues containing research reports

## üíª Coding Tasks

The samples in this repo include workflows that can help with coding tasks, such as solving issues, updating documentation, and performing QA tasks.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Coding tasks should be installed with caution and used only experimentally, and then disabled. While the tasks are executed within GitHub Actions, and are relatively sandboxed, operating over their own copy of the repository, they still operate in an environment where outward network requests are allowed and egress is possible. Also, you will require you to configure additional `Bash` commands to build and test your project by editing the markdown workflow file to add those commands and then running `gh aw compile` to update the workflow. The worfklows below will attempt to "self-report" the commands they need to run, so you can look at the initial reports to see what commands are needed.

### üì¶ Daily Dependency Updater

- Configure which dependencies to include/exclude from automated updates
- After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow.

**What it reads from GitHub:**
- Repository contents and dependency files
- Issues and their metadata
- Discussions and community content
- Actions workflow runs and results
- Checks and status information
- Security events and Dependabot alerts

**What it creates:**
- Creates pull requests with dependency updates
- Creates new branches for the dependency changes
- Makes file changes to update dependency versions
- Requires `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions

**Human in the loop:**
- Review dependency update pull requests for breaking changes
- Test updated dependencies to ensure compatibility
- Merge approved pull requests after validation
- Monitor for any issues after dependency updates are deployed
- Disable or uninstall the workflow if dependency updates cause more problems than benefits

**Activity duration:**
- By default this workflow will trigger for at most 48 hours, after which it will stop triggering. 
- This allows you to experiment with the workflow for a limited time before deciding whether to keep it active.

‚ö†Ô∏è See notes above on coding tasks.
