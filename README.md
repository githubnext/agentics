## üìö Weekly Research

The [weekly research workflow](workflows/weekly-research.md?plain=1) will run each Monday morning to collect research updates from the team and post them to a new issue in the repository. You can edit the workflow to adjust the topics, length and texture of the report. 

```bash
gh aw add weekly-research -r githubnext/agentics --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository. After merging the PR and syncing to main, you can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run weekly-research
```

**Activity Duration:** By default this workflow will stay active for 30 days before automatically stopping.

**What it reads from GitHub:**
- Repository contents and file structure
- Pull requests and their metadata
- Discussions and community content
- Actions workflow runs and results
- Checks and status information

**What it creates:**
- Creates new issues containing research reports
- Requires `issues: write` permission

**What web searches it performs:**
- Searches for latest trends and news from software industry sources
- Looks up information about related products and competitive analysis
- Searches for relevant research papers and academic content
- May search for market opportunities and business insights

## üë• Daily Team Status

The [daily team status workflow](workflows/daily-team-status.md?plain=1) will run daily to assess activity in the repository and create a status report issue. You can edit the workflow to adjust the topics and texture of the report. 

```bash
gh aw add daily-team-status -r githubnext/agentics --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository. After merging the PR and syncing to main, you can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw add daily-plan -r githubnext/agentics --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository. After merging the PR and syncing to main, you can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run daily-plan

- Searches for relevant information to assist with issue triage
- May look up documentation, error messages, or similar issues

## üíª Coding Tasks

The samples in this repo include workflows that can help with coding tasks, such as solving issues, updating documentation, and performing QA tasks.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Coding tasks should be installed with caution and used only experimentally, and then disabled. While the tasks are executed within GitHub Actions, and are relatively sandboxed, operating over their own copy of the repository, they still operate in an environment where outward network requests are allowed. Also, you will require you to configure additional `Bash` commands to build and test your project by editing the markdown workflow file to add those commands and then running `gh aw compile` to update the workflow. The worfklows below will attempt to "self-report" the commands they need to run, so you can look at the initial reports to see what commands are needed.

### üì¶ Daily Dependency Updater

The [daily dependency updater workflow](workflows/daily-dependency-updates.md?plain=1) will run daily to check for Dependabot alerts in the repository and update dependencies to the latest versions, creating pull requests as necessary.

```bash
gh aw add daily-dependency-updates -r githubnext/agentics --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository. After merging the PR and syncing to main, you can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run daily-dependency-updates
```

**Activity Duration:** By default this workflow will stay active for 48 hours before automatically stopping.

**What it reads from GitHub:**
- Repository contents and dependency files
- Issues and their metadata
- Discussions and community content
- Actions workflow runs and results
- Checks and status information
- Security events and Dependabot alerts

**What it creates:**
- Creates pull requests with dependency updates
- Creates new branches for the dependency changes
- Makes file changes to update dependency versions
- Requires `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions

‚ö†Ô∏è See notes above on coding tasks.

## üìñ Regular Documentation Update

The [update documentation workflow](workflows/update-docs.md?plain=1) will run on each push to main to try to update documentation in the repository. It defaults to using [Astro Starlight] (https://starlight.astro.build) for documentation generation, but you can edit it to use other frameworks if necessary.

```bash
gh aw add update-docs -r githubnext/agentics --pr
```
