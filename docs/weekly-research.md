# ðŸ“š Weekly Research

> For an overview of all available workflows, see the [main README](../README.md).

The [weekly research workflow](../workflows/weekly-research.md?plain=1) will run each Monday morning to collect research updates from the team and post them to a new issue in the repository. You can edit the workflow to adjust the topics, length and texture of the report. 

## Installation

```bash
gh aw add weekly-research -r githubnext/agentics --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository. After merging the PR and syncing to main, you can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run weekly-research
```

**Checklist**

* [ ] If in a fork, enable GitHub Actions and Issues in the fork settings

## Configuration

- No build steps required - works out of the box
- Edit the workflow file to customize output format, research topics, report length, focus areas or to adjust frequency or timing
- After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow and commit all changes to the default branch.
