# 🔍 Repo Ask

> For an overview of all available workflows, see the [main README](../README.md).

The [repo-ask workflow](../workflows/repo-ask.md?plain=1) is a command-triggered workflow that acts as an intelligent research assistant for your repository. When invoked with the `repo-ask` command, it provides accurate, well-researched answers to questions about your codebase, features, documentation, or any repository-related topics by leveraging web search, repository analysis, and bash commands.

You can trigger the workflow by adding a comment to any issue or pull request with the command:

```
/repo-ask
```

or by writing a comment with a specific question:

```
/repo-ask How does the authentication system work in this project?
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install the 'gh aw' extension
gh aw extension install githubnext/agentics

# Add the Repo Ask workflow to your repository
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/repo-ask --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository.

You must also add [choose a coding agent](https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/reference/engines/) and add an API key secret for the agent to your repository.

You can't start a run of this workflow directly as it is triggered in the context of an issue or pull request comment.

To trigger the workflow on a specific issue or pull request, add a comment with the command:

```
/repo-ask [your question here]
```

**Mandatory Checklist**

* [ ] I have read the notes on coding tasks in the [main README](../README.md) and understand the implications.

* [ ] I understand that this workflow will generate and run bash commands in the confine of the GitHub Actions VM, with network access.

* [ ] I am a repository admin, maintainer, or have write permissions to trigger this workflow.

* [ ] If in a fork, I have enabled "GitHub Actions" and "GitHub Issues" in the fork repository settings.

## Configuration

This workflow requires no configuration and works out of the box. You can customize research behavior, response format, and allowed tools. Local configuration can be done in `.github/workflows/agentics/repo-ask.config.md`.

After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow and commit all changes to the default branch.

## What it reads from GitHub

- Repository contents and file structure
- Issue or pull request context where the command was triggered
- Pull requests and their metadata
- Actions workflow runs and results
- Repository documentation and code files
- Project configuration files

## What it creates

- Adds detailed research-based comments to issues or pull requests
- Requires `issues: write` permission

## What web searches it performs

- Searches for relevant documentation and resources online
- Looks up technical information related to the repository's technologies
- Researches best practices and solutions for specific questions
- May search for community discussions and expert opinions

## What bash commands it runs

- Repository analysis commands (e.g., `find`, `grep`, `ls`)
- Code inspection commands to understand project structure
- Test execution to verify functionality
- Build commands to understand the development workflow
- Any other repository exploration commands needed to answer questions

## Use Cases

- **Documentation Research**: Ask about how specific features work or are implemented
- **Code Analysis**: Get explanations of complex code patterns or architectures  
- **Troubleshooting**: Research solutions for build issues or configuration problems
- **Best Practices**: Get recommendations for improving code or project structure
- **Feature Investigation**: Understand what features exist and how they're used
- **Dependency Analysis**: Learn about project dependencies and their purposes

## Example Commands

```
/repo-ask Has anyone reported similar issues in the past?
/repo-ask Is this bug related to any known issues in the codebase?
/repo-ask What are the testing requirements for this type of change?
/repo-ask How does this PR affect the existing authentication flow?
/repo-ask Are there similar implementations I should look at for reference?
/repo-ask What's the best way to test this feature locally?
/repo-ask Does this change require any documentation updates?
/repo-ask What are the performance implications of this approach?
```

## Human in the loop

- Review research findings and answers provided by the workflow
- Ask follow-up questions or request clarification as needed
- Validate technical recommendations before implementing them
